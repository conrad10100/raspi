creating this in hopes of making it easier for family to keep track of grandma's medication. Intent is to have her push the button
that will take a picture of her pill organizer so we will know if she took it or not and can remind her if not. I think this will 
make her feel more independent as she won't be constantly called to see if she took her medicine, as well as save time for others.

Next step is to make a script that runs this program on startup, and deletes the previous image after it is uploaded.
